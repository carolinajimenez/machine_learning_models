# Machine Learning Models

This repository comprises the development of three models: the first is an unsupervised model, the second is a forecasting model and the third is a classification model.

## Transaction Forecasting

This project aims to predict future transactional behaviors, such as the next purchase amount, based on historical transaction data.

### Overview

The project involves preprocessing transaction data, training a forecasting model using a RandomForestRegressor, and visualizing the results to interpret the model's performance.

### Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values, encodes categorical variables, normalizes numerical variables, and extracts features from dates.
- **Model Training**: Uses a RandomForestRegressor to predict the transaction amount based on the processed features.
- **Results Visualization**: Provides visual insights into the model's predictions, feature importances, and residuals.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.9 installed along with the packages listed in `requirements.txt`.
